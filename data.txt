DISCLAIMER
Though all possible
care
has been taken to ensure accuracy
and
consistency, in the event of
a
conflict between the Guide and Government
orders/ instructions
on
the subject, the latter will prevail.
Any information given herein cannot be cited in
any
dispute
or
litigation,
nor
is ita substitute for
a
legal interpretation/ evidence. The
user
will be solely
responsible for
any consequence
of the decision taken
on
the basis of
information contained in this Guide.

GUIDE ON RIGHT TO INFORMATION
ACT, 2005

The right to information is implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution. However,
with
a
view to set out a
practical regime for the citizens to secure
information
as a
matter of right, the Indian Parliament enacted the Right to Information Act, 2005. This
law is
very
comprehensive and
covers
almost all matters of
governance.
This Law has
a
wide reach, being applicable to Government at all levels- Union, State and Local
as
well
as to the recipients of substantial government funds.
2. The present guide is
an
updated and consolidated guide for the
use
of all stake-
holders. This guide contains five parts. Part! of the guide discusses
some aspects of
the Act which all the stake-holders
are
required to know. Rest of the four parts are
specifically relevant to the public authorities, the information seekers, the public
information officers and the first appellate authorities respectively.
3. Contents of this guide
are
specifically relevant in relation to the Central
Government but
are
equally applicable to the State Governments except in relation to
rules about payment of fee
or
deciding of appeals by the Information Commissions. It
may
be noted that this guide
uses
the term Public Information Officer in place of Central
Public Information Officer/State Public Information Officer. Likewise Assistant P ublic
Information Officer has been used for Central Assistant Public Information Officer/S tate
Assistant Public Information Officer and Information Commission for Central Information
Commission/State Information Commission except where it
was
considered
necessary
to make specific reference to the Central Public Information Officer/Central Information
Commission etc.

Part |
FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS
Object of the Right to Information Act
4. The basic object of the Right to Information Act is to empower
the citizens, to
promote transparency and accountability in the working of the Government, to contain
corruption, and to enhance people’s participation in democratic
process
thereby making
our
democracy work for the people in
a
real
sense. It goes
without saying that
an
informed citizen is better equipped to keep
necessary
vigil
on
the instruments of
governance
and make the government more
accountable to the governed. The Actis
a
big step towards making the citizens informed about the activities of the Government.
What is Information
5. Information is
any
material in
any
form. It includes records, documents,
memos,
e-mails, opinions, advices,
press
releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts,
reports, papers,
samples, models, data material held in
any
electronic form. It also
includes information relating to any
private body which
can
be accessed by the public
authority under
any
law for the time being in force.
What is
a
Public Authority
6. A "public authority" is
any
authority
or
body
or
institution of self government
established
or
constituted by
or
under the Constitution;
or
by
any
other law made by the
Parliament or
a
State Legislature;
or
by notification issued
or
order made by the Central
Government
or a
State Government. The bodies owned, controlled
or
substantially
financed by the Central Government
or a
State Government
are
also public authorities.
Non-Government organisations substantially financed by the Central Government
or a
State Government also fall within the definition of public authority. The substantial
financing by the Central Government
or a
State Government
may
be direct
or
indirect.
The Act does not define substantial financing. Various courts/Information Commissions
have been deciding
on
this issue
on case to case
basis, depending
upon
the merits of
each
case.

Public Information Officer
7. Public authorities have designated
some
of its officers
as
Public Information
Officers. They
are
responsible to give information to a person
who seeks information
under the RTI Act.
Assistant Public Information Officer
8. These
are
the officers at sub-divisional level to whom
a person can
give his RTI
application
or
appeal. These officers send the application
or
appeal to the Public
Information Officer of the public authority
or
the concerned appellate authority. An
Assistant Public Information Officer is not responsible to supply the information.
9. The Assistant Public Information Officers appointed by the Department of Posts
in various post offices
are
working
as
Assistant Public Information Officers for all the
public authorities under the Government of India.
Right to Information under the Act
10. A citizen has
a
right to seek such information from
a
public authority which is held
by the public authority
or
which is held under its control. This right includes inspection
of work, documents and records; taking notes, extracts or
certified copies of documents
or
records; and taking certified samples of material held by the public authority
or
held
under the control of the public authority. It is important to note that only such
information
can
be supplied under the Act that is available and existing and is held by
the public authority
or
is held under the control of the public authority. The Public
Information Officer is not supposed to create information that is not a part of the record
of the public authority. The Public Information Officer is also not required to furnish
information which require drawing of inference and/or making of assumptions;
or to
interpret information;
or to solve the problems raised by the applicants;
or to furnish
replies to hypothetical questions.
11. A citizen has
a
right to obtain information from
a
public authority in the form of
diskettes, floppies, tapes, video cassettes or
in
any
other electronic mode
or
through
print-outs provided such information is already stored in
a computer or
in
any
other
device.
12. | The information to the applicant should ordinarily be provided in the form in which
it is sought. However, if the supply of information sought in
a
particular form would

disproportionately divert the
resources
of the public authority
or may cause
harm to the
safety
or
preservation of the records, supply of information in that form
may
be denied.
13. In some cases,
the applicants expect the Public Information Officer to give
information in
some
particular proforma devised by them
on
the plea that they have
a
right to get information in the form in which it is sought. It need be noted that the
provision in the Act simply
means
that if the information is sought in the form of
photocopy, it shall be provided in the form of photocopy,
or
if itis sought in the form of a
floppy
or
in
any
other electronic mode, it shall be provided in that form, subject to the
conditions given in the Act. It does not mean
that the PIO shall re-shape the
information.
14. Some Information Seekers request the Public Information Officers to cull out
information from
some
document(s) and give such extracted information to them. A
citizen has
a
right to get ‘material’ from
a
public authority which is held by
or
under the
control of that public authority. The Act, however, does not require the Public
Information Officer to deduce
some
conclusion from the ‘material’ and supply the
‘conclusion’
so
deduced to the applicant. It
means
that the Public Information Officer is
required to supply the ‘material’ in the form
as
held by the public authority, but not to do
research
on

Part ll
FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES
Public authorities
are
the repository of information which the citizens have
a
right
to access
under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The Act casts important obligations
on
public authorities
so as to facilitate the citizens of the country to access
the
information held under their control.
Maintenance and Computerisation of Records
2. Proper management of records is of utmost importance for effective
implementation of the provisions of the Act. A public authority should, therefore,
maintain all its records properly. It should
ensure
that the records
are
duly catalogued
and indexed in such
a
manner
and
form that it
may
facilitate the right to information.
Suo Motu Disclosure
3. Every public authority should provide
as
much information
suo motu to the public
through various
means
of communications
so
that the public have minimum need to use
the Act to obtain information. Internet being
one
of the most effective
means
of
communication, the information
may
be posted
on
the website.
4. Section 4(1)(b) of the Act, in particular, requires
every
public authority to publish
following sixteen categories of information:
(i) the particulars of its organisation, functions and duties;
(ii) the
powers
and duties of its officers and employees;
(iii) the procedure followed in the decision making
process,
including channels of
supervision and accountability;
(iv) the

bodies
are open to the public,
or

(xv) the particulars of facilities available to citizens for obtaining information,
including the working hours of
a
library
or
reading
room,
if maintained for
public
use;
(xvi) the
names,

Officers.
5. Besides the categories of information enumerated above, the Government has
issued guidelines that the following categories of information
may
be published by the
public authorities:
.
Information relating to procurement
ii, Public Private Partnerships
iii. Transfer Policy and Transfer Orders
iv. RTI Applications
v.
CAG & PAC
paras
Vi.
vii.
Citizens Charter
Discretionary and Non-discretionary grants
viii. Foreign Tours of PM/Ministers and senior officers
6. In addition, the Government
may
prescribe other categories of information to be
published by
any
public authority. It need be stressed that publication of the information
as
referred to above is not optional. It is
a statutory requirement which
every
public
authority is bound to meet.
13

7. Proactive disclosure should be done in the local language
so
that it remains
accessible to public. It should be presented in
a
form that is easily understood and if
technical words
are
used they should be carefully explained. As provided in section 4,
disclosure should be made in
as many
mediums
as
feasible such
as
notice boards,
newspapers,
public announcements, media broadcast, the internet or
any
other
means.
The disclosures should be kept
up to date. The disclosure of Information
may
be made
keeping in mind the provisions of Section 8 to 11 of the RTI Act.
8. Every public authority should keep in view that Proactive disclosures
on
its
website
are
complete, easily accessible, technology and platform neutral and in
a
form
which
conveys
the desired information in
an
effective and user-friendly
manner.
9. Each Central Ministry/ Public Authority should get its proactive disclosure
package audited by third party every year.
Such audit should be communicated to the
Central Information Commission annually through publication
on
their
own
websites. All
Public Authorities should proactively disclose the
names
of the third party auditors
on
their website. For carrying out third party audit through outside consultants also,
Ministries/P ublic Authorities should utilize their plan/non-plan funds.
10. Each Central Ministry/ Public Authority should appoint
a
senior officer not below
the rank of
a J oint Secretary and not below rank of Additional HOD in
case
of attached
offices for ensuring compliance with the proactive disclosure guidelines.
Designation of PlOs and APIOs etc.
11. Every public authority is required to designate Public Information Officers in all
the administrative units
or
offices under it. Every public authority is also required to
designate Assistant Public Information Officers at each sub-divisional level. The
Government of India has decided that Central Assistant Public Information Officers
(CAPIOs) appointed by the Department of Posts would act as
CAPIOs for all the public
authorities under the Government of India.
Designation of Appellate Authority
12. Sub-section (8) of Section 7 of the RTI Act provides that where
a request for
information is rejected, the Public Information Officer shall, inter-alia, communicate the
particulars of the Appellate Authority to the
person
making the request. Thus, the
applicant is informed about the particulars of the Appellate Authority when
a request for
information is rejected but there
may
be
cases
where the Public Information Officer
does not reject the application, but the applicant does not receive
a
decision within the
time
as
specified in the Act or
he is aggrieved by the decision of the Public Information
Officer. In such
a case
the applicant
may
like to exercise his right to appeal. But in
absence of the particulars of the appellate authority, the applicant
may
face difficulty in
making
an
appeal. All the public authorities should also designate the First Appellate
Authorities and publish their particulars alongwith the particulars of the Public
Information Officers.
14

Acceptance of Fee
13. According to the Right to Information Rules, 2012,
an
applicant
can
make
payment of fee in cash to the public authority
or
CAPIO
or
by demand draft
or
banker’s
cheque
or
Indian Postal Order payable to the Accounts Officer of the public authority.
The payment of fee to the Central Ministries/departments
can
also be made online
through internet banking of State Bank of India
or
through Master/Visa Debit/credit
cards. The public authority should
ensure
that payment by
any
of the above modes is
not denied
or
the applicant is not compelled to draw IPO etc. in the
name
of
any
officer
other than the Accounts Officer. If
any
public authority does not have
any Accounts
Officer, it should designate
an
officer
as
such for the
purpose
of receiving fee under the
RTI Act and Rules made thereunder.
Compliance of the Orders of the Information Commission
14. The decisions of the Commission
are
binding. The public authority should
ensure
that the orders passed by the Commission
are
implemented. If
any
public
authority
or a
PIO is of the view that
an
order of the Commission is not in
consonance
with the provisions of the Act, it
may
approach the High Court by
way
of
a
Writ Petition.
Creation of RTI Cell
15. Sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Right to Information Act, 2005 mandates all
public authorities to designate
as many
Public Information Officers
as necessary to
provide information under the Act. Where
a
public authority designates
more
than
one
Public Information Officer (PIO),
an
applicant is likely to face difficulty in approaching
the appropriate Public Information Officer. The applicants would also face problem in
identifying the officer senior in rank to the Public Information Officer to whom
an
appeal
under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Act can
be made. Therefore all public
authorities with
more
than
one
PIO should create a RT! Cell within the organisation to
receive all the RTI applications and first appeals and to route them to the concerned
PIOs/FAAs. Detailed instructions regarding setting
up
of RTI Cell, its functions and
financial assistance in setting
up RTI Cell have been issued by the Department.
Transfer of Applications
16. The Act provides that if
an
application is made to a
public authority requesting for
an
information, which is held by another public authority;
or
the subject matter of which
is
more
closely connected with the functions of another public authority, the public
authority, to which such application is made, shall transfer the application
or
relevant
part of it to that other public authority within five days from the receipt of the application.
15

The public authority should sensitize its officers about this provision of the Act lest the
public authority is held responsible for delay.
17. Ifa
person
makes
an
application to a
public authority for information,
a part of
which is available with that public authority and the rest of the information is
scattered with
more
than
one
other public authorities, in such
a case,
the PIO of the
public authority receiving the application should give information relating to it and
advise the applicant to make separate applications to the concerned public
authorities for obtaining information from them. If
no
part of the information sought, is
available with it but is scattered with
more
than
one
other public authorities, the PIO
should inform the applicant that information is not available with the public authority
and that the applicant should make separate applications to the concerned public
authorities for obtaining information from them. However, if the details of public
authorities who
may
have the information sought by the applicant
are
available with
the PIO, such details
may
also be provided to the applicant.
18. If
a person
makes
an
application to a
public authority for
some
information
which is the
concern
of
a
public authority under
any
State Government
or
the Union
Territory Administration, the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the public
authority receiving the application should inform the applicant that the information
may
be had from the concerned State Government/UT Administration. Application, in
such
a case,
need not be transferred to the State Government/UT Administration.
Annual Report of the CIC
19. The Information Commissions, after the end of each
year, are
required to
prepare reports on
the implementation of the provisions of the Act during that
year.
Each Ministry
or Department is required, in relation to the public authorities within its
jurisdiction, to collect and provide information to the concerned Information Commission
for preparation of the report. The report of the Commission, inter-alia, contains following
information in respect of the year
to which the report relates—
(a) the number of requests made to each public authority;
(b) the number of decisions where applicants
were not entitled to access to the
documents pursuant to the requests, the provisions of the Act under which
these decisions
were
made and the number of times such provisions
were
invoked;
(c) particulars of
any
disciplinary action taken against
any
officer in respect of the
administration of the Act;
(e) the amount of charges collected by each public authority under the Act; and
(f)
any
facts which indicate
an
effort by the public authorities to administer and
implement the spirit and intention of the Act.
16

20. Every public authority should send
necessary
material to its administrative
Ministry/Department soon after the end of the year so that the Ministry/Department
may
send the information to the Commission and the Commission
may
incorporate the
same
in its report. For this
purpose, a
web based software called “RTI Annual Report
Information System” is available
on
the website of CIC namely www.cic.gov.in through
which public authorities
are
required to upload requisite reports on
quarterly basis. It is
important that all public authorities should get themselves registered with CIC for the
purpose
of this report and also upload their quarterly returns regularly and
on
time.
21. If it appears to the Information Commission that
a
practice of
a
public authority in
relation to the exercise of its functions under the Act does not conform with the
provisions
or
spirit of the Act, it
may
give
a
recommendation to the authority specifying
the steps ought to be taken for promoting such conformity. The concerned public
authority should take
necessary
action to bring its practice in conformity with the Act.
17

Part lll
FOR INFORMATION SEEKERS
Method of Seeking Information
A citizen, who desires to obtain
any
information under the Act, should make
an
application to the Public Information Officer of the concerned public authority in writing
in English
or
Hindi
or
in the official language of the
area
in which the application is
made. The application should be precise and specific. He should make payment of
application fee at the time of submitting the application
as
prescribed in the RTI Rules,
2012. The applicant
can
send the application by post or
through electronic
means or
can
deliver it personally in the office of the public authority. The application
can
also be
sent through
an
Assistant Public Information Officer.
Application to the concerned Public Authority
2. The applicant should make application to the Public Information Officer of the
concerned public authority. He should make all efforts to ascertain
as to which the
public authority is concerned with the information. If the information sought by
an
applicant is related to different PIOs in
a
Public Authority
or
is related to different Public
authorities, the supply of information is likely to take
a
lot
more
time than if the
information sought is related to a
single PIO in
one
Public Authority.
3. The applicant should not list out his grievances in the RTI application but should
clearly mention which information
or
record he would like to seek. Further, if the drafting
of the application is such that it pin points towards the specific documents required in
relation to the information sought, there would be less
scope
of ambiguity, thereby
resulting in less chances of denial of information by the Public Information Officer. For
example instead of simply asking why
my area
is not being cleaned, cleaning schedule
of the
area
should be asked. Similarly, instead of asking when
we
will get water supply,
water supply planning of the
area
should be asked.
Fee for Seeking Information
4. Along with the application, the applicant should send application fee to the Public
Information Officer. In case
of Government of India, the prescribed application fee is
Rs. 10/- which
can
be paid through
a
demand draft
or a
banker’s cheque
or an
Indian
Postal Order payable to the Accounts Officer of the public authority. The payment of fee
18

can
also be made by
way
of cash to the public authority
or to the Assistant P ublic
Information Officer against
proper
receipt. In case
of online applications to Central
Ministries/departments, fee
can
be paid online through internet banking of State Bank of
India
or
through Master/Visa credit/debit cards.
5. The applicant
may
also be required to pay
further fee towards the cost of
providing the information, details of which shall be intimated to the applicant by the
Public Information Officer. The fee
so
demanded
can
be paid the
same way as
application fee.
6. If the applicant belongs to below poverty line (BPL) category, he is not required
to pay any
fee. However, he should submit a proof in support of his claim
as
belonging
to the below poverty line category. The application not accompanied by the prescribed
application fee
or
proof of the applicant’s belonging to below poverty line category, as
the
case may
be, shall not be
a
valid application under the Act.
Format of Application
7. There is
no
prescribed format of application for seeking information. The
application
can
be made
on
a plain
paper.
The applicant should mention the address at
which the information is required to be sent. The information seeker is not required to
give
reasons
for seeking information.

authority shall dispose of the appeal within
a
period of thirty days
or

cases

on
the appeal within the
prescribed period
or
if the appellant is not satisfied with the order of the first appellate
authority, he
may

her application
or

as
the
case may

Part IV
FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICERS
The Public Information Officer of a public authority plays
a
pivotal role in making
the right of citizens to information
a
reality. The Act casts specific duties
on
him and
makes him liable for penalty in
case
of default. It is, therefore, essential for
a
Public
Information Officer to study the Act carefully and understand its provisions correctly.
Besides the issues discussed elsewhere in this document,
a
Public Information Officer
should keep the following aspects in view while dealing with the applications under the
Act.
Applications Received Without Fee
2. Soon after receiving the application, the Public Information Officer should check
whether the applicant has made the payment
of application fee
or
whether the applicant
is
a person
belonging to a
Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. If application is not
accompanied by the prescribed fee
or
the BPL Certificate, it cannot be treated
as an
application under the RTI Act. It may,
however, be noted that the Public Information
Officer should consider such
an
application sympathetically and try to supply
information sought by
way
of such
an
application.
3. A public authority
may
designate
as many
Public Information Officers for it,
as
it
may
deem
necessary. It is possible that in
a
public authority with
more
than
one
Public
Information Officer,
an
application is received by the Public Information Officer other
than the concerned Public Information Officer. In such
a case,
the Public Information
Officer receiving the application should transfer it to the concerned Public Information
Officer immediately, preferably the
same
day. Time period of five days for transfer of
the application applies only when the application is transferred from
one
public authority
to another public authority and not for transfer from
one
Public Information Officer to
another in the
same
public authority.
Rendering Assistance to Applicants
4. The RTI Act provides that the Public Information Officer has
a
duty to render
reasonable assistance to the
persons
seeking information. As per
provisions of the Act,
a person,
who desires to obtain
any
information is required to make
a request in writing
or
through electronic
means
in English
or
Hindi
or
in the official language of the
area
in
which the application is made. If a
person
seeking information is not able to make such
request in writing, the Public Information Officer should render reasonable assistance to
him to reduce the
same
in writing.
21

5. Where
access to a
record is required to be provided to a
sensorily disabled
person,
the Public Information Officer should provide assistance to such
person to
enable him to access
the information. He should also provide such assistance to the
person as may
be appropriate for the inspection of records where such inspection is
involved.
Assistance Available to PIO
6. The Public Information Officer
may
seek the assistance of any other officer
as
he
or
she considers
necessary
for the
proper
discharge of his
or
her duties. The officer,
whose assistance is
so
sought by the Public Information Officer, would render all
assistance to him. Such
an
officer shall be deemed to be
a
Public Information Officer
and would be liable for contravention of
any
provisions of the Act the
same way as any
other Public Information Officer. It would be advisable for the Public Information Officer
to inform the officer whose assistance is sought, about the above provision, at the time
of seeking his assistance.
7. Some Public Information Officers,
on
the basis of above referred provision of the
Act, transfer the RTI applications received by them to other officers and direct them to
send information to the applicants
as
deemed Public Information Officer. Thus, they
use
the above referred provision to designate other officers
as
Public Information
Officer. According to the Act, it is the responsibility of the officer who is designated
as
the Public Information Officer by the public authority to provide information to the
applicant
or
reject the application for
any reasons
specified in Sections 8 and 9 of the
Act. The Act enables the Public Information Officer to seek assistance of
any
other
officer to enable him to provide information to the information seeker, but it does not
give him authority to designate
any
other officer
as
Public Information Officer and direct
him to send reply to the applicant. The import of the provision is that, if the officer
whose assistance is sought by the Public Information Officer, does not render
necessary
help to him, the Information Commission
may
impose penalty
on
such officer
or
recommend disciplinary action against him the
same way as
the Commission
may
impose penalty
on or
recommend disciplinary action against the Public Information
Officer.
Supply of Information
8. The answering Public Information Officer should check whether the information
sought
or a
part thereof is exempt from disclosure under Section 8
or
Section 9 of the
Act. Request in respect of the part of the application which is
so exempt may
be
rejected and rest of the information should be provided immediately
or
after receipt of
additional fees,
as
the
case may
be.
22

9. Where
a
request for information is rejected, the Public Information Officer should
communicate to the
person
making the request—
(i) the
reasons
for such rejection;
(ii) the period within which
an
appeal against such rejection
may
be preferred;
and
(ili) | the particulars of the authority to whom
an
appeal
can
be made.
10. If additional fee is required to be paid by the applicant
as
provided in the Fee
and Cost Rules, the Public Information Officer should inform the applicant:
(i) the details of further fees required to be paid;
(ii) the calculations made to arrive at the amount of fees asked for;
(ili) | the fact that the applicant has
a
right to make appeal about the amount of fees
so
demanded;
(iv) the particulars of the authority to whom such
an
appeal
can
be made; and
(v) the time limit within which the appeal
can
be made.
11. Though there is
no
hard and fast rule
as to when exactly intimation about
additional fees is to be given to the applicant, such intimation should be given
soon
after
receipt of RTI application.
Supply of Part Information by Severance
12. Where
a request is received for
access to information which is exempt from
disclosure but
a part of which is not exempt, and such part can
be severed in such
a
way
that the severed part does not contain exempt information then,
access to that part
of the information/record
may
be provided to the applicant. Where
access
is granted to
a part of the record in such
a way,
the Public Information Officer should inform the
applicant that the information asked for is exempt from disclosure and that only part of
the record is being provided, after
severance,
which is not exempt from disclosure.
While doing
so,
he should give the
reasons
for the decision, including
any
findings
on
any
material question of fact, referring to the material
on
which those findings
were
based.
Time Period for Supply of Information
13. The following table shows the maximum time (from the receipt of application)
which
may
be taken to dispose off the applications in different situations:

14. If the Public Information Officer fails to give decision
on
the request for
information within the prescribed period, he shall be deemed to have refused the
request. It is pertinent to note that if
a
public authority fails to comply with the specified
time limit, the information to the concerned applicant would have to be provided free of
charge.
Disclosure of Third Party Information
15. Information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or
intellectual
property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of
a
third party, is
exempt from disclosure. Such information shall not be disclosed unless the competent
24

authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such
information.
16. If
an
applicant seeks
any
information which relates to or
has been supplied by
a
third party and that third party has treated that information
as
confidential, the Public
Information Officer shall consider whether the information should be disclosed
or not.
The guiding principle in such
cases
is that except in the
case
of trade
or
commercial
secrets protected by law, disclosure
may
be allowed if the public interest in disclosure
outweighs in importance
any
possible harm
or
injury to the interests of such third party.
However, the Public Information Officer would have to follow the following procedure
before disclosing such information.
17. If the Public Information Officer intends to disclose the information, he shall
within five days from the receipt of the application, give
a
written notice to the third party
that the information has been sought by the applicant under the RTI Act and that he
intends to disclose the information. He shall request the third party to make
a
submission in writing
or
orally, regarding whether the information
may
be disclosed.
The third party shall be given
a
time of ten days, from the date of receipt of the notice by
him, to make representation against the proposed disclosure, if any.
18. The Public Information Officer shall make
a
decision regarding disclosure of the
information keeping in view the submission of the third party. Such
a
decision should
be taken within forty days from the receipt of the request for information. After taking the
decision, the Public Information Officer should give
a
notice of his decision to the third
party in writing. The notice given to the third party should include
a statement that the
third party is entitled to prefer
an
appeal under section 19 against the decision.
19. The third party can
prefer
an
appeal to the First Appellate Authority against the
decision made by the Public Information Officer within thirty days from the date of the
receipt of notice. If not satisfied with the decision of the First Appellate Authority, the
third party can
prefer a second appeal to the Information Commission.
20. If
an
appeal has been filed by the third party against the decision of the Public
Information Officer to disclose the third party information, the information should not be
disclosed till the appeal is decided.
Imposition of Penalty
21. An applicant under the Act has
a
right to appeal to the Information Commission
and also to make complaint to the Commission. Where the Information Commission at
the time of deciding
any
complaint
or
appeal is of the opinion that the Public Information
Officer has without
any
reasonable
cause,
refused to receive
an
application for
information
or
has not furnished information within the time specified
or
malafidely
denied the request for information
or
knowingly given incorrect, incomplete
or
misleading information
or
destroyed information which
was
the subject of the request or
obstructed in
any manner
in furnishing the information, it shall impose
a
penalty of two
hundred and fifty
rupees
each day till application is received
or
information is furnished
25

subject to the condition that the total amount of such penalty shall not exceed twenty-
five thousand
rupees.
The Public Information Officer shall, however, be given
a
reasonable opportunity of being heard before
any
penalty is imposed
on
him. The
burden of proving that he acted reasonably and diligently and in
case
of denial of
a
request that such denial
was
justified shall be
on
the Public Information Officer.
Disciplinary Action Against PIO
22. Where the Information Commission at the time of deciding
any
complaint
or
appeal is of the opinion that the Public Information Officer has without
any
reasonable
cause
and persistently, failed to receive
an
application for information
or
has not
furnished information within the time specified
or
malafidely denied the request for
information
or
knowingly given incorrect, incomplete
or
misleading information
or
destroyed information which
was
the subject of the request or
obstructed in
any manner
in furnishing the information, it
may
recommend disciplinary action against the Public
Information Officer.
Protection for Work Done in Good Faith
23. Section 21 of the Act provides that
no
suit, prosecution
or
other legal proceeding
shall lie against
any person
for anything which is in good faith done
or
intended to be
done under the Act or any
rule made thereunder. A Public Information Officer should,
however, note that it would be his responsibility to prove
that his action
was
in good
faith.
26

Part V
FOR FIRST APPELLATE AUTHORITIES
The first Appellate Authority has
a very
important role under the RTI Act, 2005. The
independent and judicious examination of appeals by the First Appellate Authorities
would lead to higher satisfaction to the appellants. This would, in turn, result in less
number of second appeals to the Information Commission.
2. The information sought by
an
applicant should either be supplied to him by
the Public Information Officer
or
his application should be rejected within the time
prescribed under the Act. If additional fee need be charged from the applicant, timely
communication in this regard should be sent
to him.
First Appeal
3. If the applicant does not receive information
or
decision about rejection of
request or
communication about payment of additional fee within the specified time, he
can
make
an
appeal to the First Appellate Authority. Appeal
can
also be made if the
applicant is aggrieved by the decision of the Public Information Officer regarding supply
of information
or
the quantum of fee decided by the Public Information Officer. The
applicant
may
prefer the first appeal within thirty days from the expiry of such period
or
from the receipt of such
a
decision of the Public Information Officer.
4. The First Appellate Authority
may
admit the appeal after expiry of the period of
thirty days if he
or
she is satisfied that the appellant
was
prevented by sufficient
cause
from filing the appeal in time.
5. A third party can
also prefer
an
appeal to the First Appellate Authority against the
order of the Public Information Officer to disclose third party information. Such
an
appeal shall be made within thirty days from the date of the order.
Disposal of Appeal
6. While disposing off first appeals, the first Appellate Authorities should act in a fair
and judicious
manner. It is
very
important that the order passed by the first appellate
authority should be
a
detailed and speaking order, giving justification for the decision
arrived at.
7. If
an
appellate authority while deciding
an
appeal
comes to a
conclusion that the
appellant should be supplied information in addition to what has been supplied by the
27

Public Information Officer, he
may
either (i)
pass an
order directing the Public
Information Officer to give such information to the appellant;
or
(ii) he himself
may
give
information to the appellant. In the first
case
the appellate authority should
ensure
that
the information ordered by him to be supplied is supplied to the appellant immediately.
It would, however, be better if the appellate authority chooses the second
course
of
action and he himself furnishes the information alongwith the order passed by him in the
matter.
8. lf, in
any case,
the Public Information Officer does not implement the order
passed by the appellate authority and the appellate authority feels that intervention of
higher authority is required to get his order implemented, he should bring the matter to
the notice of the officer in the public authority competent to take action against the
Public Information Officer. Such competent officer shall take
necessary
action
so as to
ensure
implementation of the provisions of the RT| Act.
Time limit for disposal of appeal
9. The first appellate authority should dispose off the appeal within 30 days of
receipt of the appeal. In some
exceptional
cases,
the Appellate Authority
may
take 45
days for its disposal. However, in such
cases,
the Appellate Authority should record, in
writing, the
reasons
for not
deciding the appeal within 30 days.
